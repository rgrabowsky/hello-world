Repository used to learn how to use GitHub

Hi!

Rodrigo here, I have experience with web-development (MEAN stack) and other projects in C++.
I'm a Computer Science undergrad at Stanford University, currently starting a track in Artificial Intelligence. 
I'm very new to this area of CS and interested in learning more about it!
